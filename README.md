### Business Context
Star Digital has identified a significant trend where a considerable portion of potential customers invests a substantial amount of their time in online activities. Moreover, there is a growing inclination among customers to consume media and make purchases through online channels. In response to this evolving landscape, Star Digital has been progressively increasing its allocation of advertising budget to online platforms, placing a particular emphasis on banner ads.

### Business Problem
To better quantify the impact of display advertising on sales conversion, Star Digital aims to initiate an experiment to assess user behavior in scenarios where individuals were exposed or not exposed to Star Digital's online ads. The key questions that Star Digital seeks to address are as follows:

1. Is online advertising effective for Star Digital?
2. Is there a frequency effect of advertising on purchase?
3. Which sites should Star Digital prioritize for advertising?

### Approach to Problem Resolution
In this project, we utilize the R programming language to execute a causal experiment to address previously outlined business problems. The systematic approach involves the following steps:

1. Dataset Exploration: Ensure an even data distribution between the control and test groups.
2. SUTVA Assumption: Verify that the Stable Unit Treatment Value Assumption (SUTVA) is not violated, ensuring the integrity of experimental conditions.
3. Sample Size Analysis: Conduct a power test to guarantee a sufficient sample size for robust statistical analysis.
4. Randomization Check: Employ a t-test to assess the effectiveness of randomization, ensuring comparability between the test and control groups.
